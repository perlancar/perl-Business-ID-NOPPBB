Revision history for Business-ID-NOPPBB

0.07    2015-07-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- Split pericmd CLI scripts to App-IndonesianNumberUtils to reduce
	  dependencies on our dist.


0.06     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.05     2014-07-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Switch CLI scripts from using Perinci::CmdLine to
           Perinci::CmdLine::Any to reduce size of dependencies.


0.04     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.03    2013-05-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add script: bin/parse-nop-pbb.

        - Add result fields: {eng,ind}_province_name.


0.02    2012-03-23 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Remove dependency to old module Sub::Spec.


0.01    2011-12-14 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release.
